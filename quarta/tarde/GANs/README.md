# Generative Adversarial Networks

Here I bring you two Jupyter notebooks where we develop GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) both in Keras and Tensorflow.

The Keras model output is a classification (Supervised Learning) and we will try different strategies of update in Discriminator 
and Generator, to increase/decrease the accuracy of The Discriminator. We may try:
- 1:1 update
- 5:1 update
- 1:5 update
- random update
- synchronous update

The Tensorflow model allow us to visualize the image output of the Generator and the Discriminator, to see if the Generator is 
fooling the Discriminator.

Keras version used in models: keras==2.0.8

Tensorflow version: tensorflow==1.3.0

Also, visit my personal Github Repo-2017, where I have more than 70 Machine Learning codes, including Machine Learning, Deep
Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing models:
